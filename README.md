# Maze Navigation with Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a maze navigation system using Q-learning reinforcement learning. The agent learns to navigate through a maze, avoiding walls and obstacles.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains all source code files.
  - `main.py`: Main script to run the simulation and training.
  - `maze_env.py`: Defines the maze environment and logic.
  - `q_learning_agent.py`: Implements the Q-Learning algorithm and agent behavior.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions (optional for future enhancements).
  
- `models/`: Stores the trained model (Q-table).
- `logs/`: Logs of the training process.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Install required libraries:
